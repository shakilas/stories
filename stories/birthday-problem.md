# Birthday Problem

Once upon a time, there were three mice named Lila, Zuzu and Jack. Lila’s birthday was coming up and Zuzu and Jack wanted to plan a surprise birthday party for Lila. But, when Reggie the lion heard that Lila’s birthday was coming up, he was furious. He called his goblins to come for a meeting. He told the goblins to dress up as the mice’s friends and make a mess at the party and take all of Lila’s birthday presents to him so that he can have his birthday instead of Lila’s.

Meanwhile, the mice were planning Lila’s birthday. Jack was in charge of making the birthday cake and decorating the room. Zuzu was in charge of making invitation and party snacks. They told squirrels to come and distract Lila so they could get the party ready.

When the day finally came, the mice made sure that everybody could come and Lila was still sleeping. When the goblins were dressed up as mice’s friends, when they went inside the room, four of the goblins ripped up the birthday banner. Two other goblins took all of the party snacks including the cake. Three more took all of Lila’s presents. One more goblin ruined all of the party games and took all of the prizes with him.

When Lila woke up, she was so upset to see that her birthday party was wrecked. Her friends told her what happened. But then she noticed that not everything was gone. She noticed that only her birthday cards were left. When she asked her friends who took her stuff, they told her that it was Reggie’s goblins. Lila was in raged when she heard it was Reggie’s goblins. She asked why Reggie’s goblins took her party stuff

Lila and Reggie used to be friends until that day when a new girl came to school and Lila forgot all about Reggie. Lila and her friends had to go to Reggies castle to get her birthday back and have a little talk with Reggie.

When they arrived at Reggie’s castle, they dressed up as Reggie’s goblins. They were able to get pass security and enter the main tower where Reggie was. But they were unlucky because Reggie noticed that it was mice and their friends. Jack’s costume was a bit ripped and Reggie could see his little mouse-tail poking out. When Reggie leaped to attack them. The mice and their friends quickly dogged Reggie. When the mice and their friends stuck Reggie, Lila asked Reggie why he sent his goblins to ruin her birthday.

Reggie told that no one remembers his birthday and he was born on the same day as Lila. Then Lila had an idea. They didn’t have to celebrate just one birthday; they could celebrate Reggie’s also. Then everyone went to the mice’s house and helped re-decorate. When it was time to blow out candles, Reggie told Lila a secret. He told Lila that he wants to be her best friend. A few days later, Reggie came to live with the mice and they all lived happily ever after.
